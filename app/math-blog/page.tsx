                The core of this website is my custom Elo rating system modified from the standard Elo formula made famous in chess. Each team is given a completely independent Elo rating for each map. This gives my rating system significantly greater predictive power. This is because Valorant teams can have dramatically different skill levels across different maps.

                <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                  The rating scale acts as the divisor that controls the spread of Elo ratings in the system. 
                  Increasing this value widens the Elo gap required to achieve the same win probability. 
                  In traditional chess Elo (400-point scale), a 400-point gap yields ~91% win probability 
                  (e.g., 1600 vs 1200). In my 1000-point scale, that same 91% probability requires a 
                  1000-point gap (e.g., 1600 vs 600). 
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I decided to increase the scale because all VCT teams are professionals. The skill gap 
                  between the best and worst pro team is far smaller than between the best and worst 
                  player on Chess.com. The wider scale makes rating differences more visually apparent 
                  and meaningful for users interacting with the website.

                  For the following parameters, rather than arbitrarily selecting parameter values, I used a systematic grid search approach 
                  to optimize the Elo system's predictive accuracy. This involved training multiple models with 
                  different combinations of parameters and evaluating their performance on unseen match data.

                  <li>Varied K-factor values (32, 48, 64, 74, 80, 96)</li>

                <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                  The best performing model achieved the lowest Brier error with a <strong>K-factor of 74</strong> and 
                  a <strong>margin multiplier of 5.95</strong> in the logarithmic scaling function. This combination 
                  balanced rating responsiveness with predictive stability, outperforming both more conservative 
                  and more aggressive parameter choices.

                <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                  The margin of victory adjustment adds critical context by incorporating the score differential 
                  into the rating calculation. This ensures that dominant victories yield larger rating changes 
                  than narrow wins.
                </p>
                <br />
                <div className="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                  <code className="text-sm">
                    margin_factor = ln(5.95 × √(score_difference + 1))

                <br />
                <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                  The logarithmic scaling provides diminishing returns for larger score differences. For example, 
                  a 13-5 victory yields a greater reward than a 13-11 victory, but the marginal increase in reward 
                  for winning 13-10 vs 13-11 is higher than the increase for 13-5 vs 13-6. This prevents extreme 
                  rating swings from blowout matches while still recognizing dominant performances.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                  This logarithmic scaling ensures that dominant victories (13-0, 13-1) provide significantly 
                  more rating changes than close matches (13-11), while preventing extreme outliers.

                <h4 className="font-semibold mb-3">3. K-Factor</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                  The K-factor controls the maximum amount of rating change that can occur in a single match.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Tuning the K-factor involves finding a balance in how responsive the rating system is to new data.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  A higher K-factor will result in more volatile rating changes, while a lower K-factor will result in more stable rating changes.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In my case, my grid search settled on a K-factor of 74. This is substantially higher than what is used in traditional systems like chess Elo.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  My personal intuition for this is that because Valorant is a rapidly evolving game, unlike chess which hasn&apos;t been updated since the addition of castling, it is beneficial to update more quickly to additional data.

                <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-3">
                  There were several alternative methods that I considered for the Elo system that are worth noting for completeness.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <h5 className="font-semibold text-sm mb-2 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Hybrid Global Offset</h5>
                  <br />
                  The hybrid global offset method is a modification of my custom Elo formula that creates a global Elo rating for each team and then adds a map-specific offset to the rating for each map, rather than having completely independent ratings per map.
                  In testing, this method did perform slightly better than the completely independent method, however the prediction quality was exclusively better at the beginning of seasons where the global offset was able to more quickly update to a teams relative strength on maps with little or no data yet. The two models otherwise converged to the same results by the middle and end of each season.
                  Because of this, I decided to stick with the completely independent method for the final model for simplicity for Users viewing the website.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                </p>
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-3">
                  <h5 className="font-semibold text-sm mb-2 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Model K-Factor Updating Confidence</h5>
                  <br />
                  I also experimented with a K-Factor updating confidence approach. This means the model would dynamically adjust the K-Factor based on the amount of time between matches. So the K-factor would start higher at the beginning of the season and gradually shrink as it got more data. The model starts updating more quickly while it has low confidence in the team&apos;s skill level and then updates more slowly as it gets more data. The K-Factor would then increase again after long breaks within the season as the teams have time to make changes.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In testing though, this model did not perform as well as without this additional parameter confidence method.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I was quite surprised by this result, however my best guess as to why is some combination of factors: the data is sparse as is, and decaying the K-Factor was ultimately causing more harm than good. As well as that teams are able to make significant changes to their playstyle and strategy even in the middle of a season and our reduced K-Factor more slowly adjusted to these mid-season changes.

                  <h5 className="font-semibold text-sm mb-2 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Regional Elo Multiplier</h5>
                  <br />
                  I plan on testing a regional Elo multiplier for each map in the future. This is because teams play so many of their matches regionally that the model is at risk of not fully accounting for differences in skill level between regions.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Differences between regions are currently sorted out between teams competing internationally where teams from stronger regions will win more often and therefore &quot;bring back&quot; the gained Elo to the regional events.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I however am not convinced this is sufficient to calibrate the regional differences fully. 
                  A thought I plan on exploring is giving each region a multiplier that is impacted by the result of each international match, weighting the Elos of every team in the region based on the result rather than just relying on individual team Elo gains/losses waterfalling down to the rest of the region. This would also be map-independent, as regions may have better strategies on some maps and not others.

                <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                  This algorithm assumes a perfectly zero-sum game. For any given map, Team A&apos;s win probability is exactly (1 - Team B&apos;s win probability). This creates a critical property: your worst map is always your opponent&apos;s best map, and vice versa.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This perfect opposition means the greedy algorithm (always ban worst, always pick best) 
                  is provably optimal. There is no strategic scenario where deviating from this strategy 
                  would improve your expected win probability. When you ban your worst map (say 30% win rate), 
                  you&apos;re simultaneously banning your opponent&apos;s best map (their 70% win rate). Any other choice 
                  would help your opponent more than it helps you.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The only scenario where strategic deviation could be beneficial is if you expect your opponent 
                  to select suboptimally, but modeling opponent mistakes is beyond the scope of this current system, which 
                  assumes rational play from both teams.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  A potential future addition would be to model each team&apos;s actual historical map choice patterns 
                  and provide an option to use predicted map selection based on past behavior, rather than assuming 
                  optimal selection.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  With a model for each team&apos;s actual historical map choice patterns, we could create a predicted map pool for a given matchup for a user to view. We could also create an optimal map selection algorithm for a given team to exploit predicted suboptimal map selection by the opponent.

                  Now that we have a system that can predict the outcome of any match, we create a (simulate_match_result) function that simulates the map selection phase, assuming optimal map selection, and then gets the win probabilities for each map using our match probability calculator.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Then all that is left is to design the tournament structure and simulate the tournament using a Monte Carlo simulation approach.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  For each iteration, we simulate each match using the given win probabilities from our simulate_match_result function. Using the calculated probabilities, we generate a random outcome from the distribution. We record that result for each match, moving on to the next until we complete the full tournament.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Once we simulate the tournament in its entirety N times (we currently use 10,000), we aggregate the number of times each team made it to each stage of the tournament, giving us the probability of each team making it to each stage of the tournament.

                  VPM is a composite player rating metric that combines traditional box score statistics with 
                  time-series modeling to estimate a player&apos;s true skill level in relation to rounds won or lost for their team compared to an average replacement player.

                  <br />
                  The system processes every map a player has ever played and outputs a single number that 
                  represents their current skill level, normalized to a standard 24-round map. The rating 
                  updates after each game, adapting to recent form while maintaining historical context.

                  This ensures ratings are comparable across different eras and accounts for meta shifts that 
                  affect overall scoring levels. A VPM of +2.0 means the player provides 2 rounds worth of value

                  Every competitive Valorant match begins with a pick/ban phase where teams alternately select and 
                  eliminate maps. These decisions are critical—a poor veto can cost a team the match before a single 
                  round is played. The pick/ban analysis system evaluates the quality of these decisions by comparing 
                  actual choices to optimal ones based on historical Elo ratings.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This creates a &quot;draft score&quot; for each team, measuring how well they maximize their competitive 
                  advantage during the veto phase. Teams that consistently make suboptimal picks/bans leave Elo 
                  rating on the table, reducing their match win probability.
